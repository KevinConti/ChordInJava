Please run this program in an IDE (recommended IDE is IntellijIDE, as this project uses the default project scaffolding). No scripts are provided for running in the command line.

This program was written using JDK 9.0, and is expected to run using the main() method. Tests are provided but were used solely for development and are not intended for user use.

Known bugs:
In Chord algorithm, the program will find a the first highest finger table entry and compare it to the keyID to find. This is problematic when the keyId is less than the lowest fingerTable value.

If code does not run properly in your environment, please clone the GitHub repository at https://github.com/KevinConti/ChordInJava
If this still does not work, a demonstration will happily be provided.
